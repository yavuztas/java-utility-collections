# Writing a Utility Class for Collections in Java 8
This repository is an implementation of a simple utility class that handles basic collection conversions and manipulations
in a practical way by the help of [Java 8 Stream API](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-streams).

Feel free to check usage samples over on [UtilsForCollectionsTest.java](https://github.com/yavuztas/java-utility-collections/blob/master/src/test/java/dev/yavuztas/utils/test/UtilsForCollectionsTest.java)
