# Writing a Utility Class for Collections in Java 8
This repository is an implementation of a simple utility class that handles basic collection conversions and manipulations

Feel free to check usage samples on [UtilsForCollectionsTest.java](https://github.com/yavuztas/java-utility-collections/blob/master/src/test/java/dev/yavuztas/utils/test/UtilsForCollectionsTest.java)
